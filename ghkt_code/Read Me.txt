Sensitivity Analysis for Golosov, Hassler, Krusell, and Tsyvinski (2014)
Author: Lint Barrage (lint_barrage@brown.edu)

The codes and files for the sensitivity analysis are as follows:

1) Parameters and Main Analysis: GHKT_Main.m
2) Objective Function: GHKT_Objective.m
3) Constraints: GHKT_Constraints.m

4) Saved primary output from different model runs is labeled as:
"x_sigX_gX_bX_dX_notes.mat"
where sigX indicates the value of sigma (e.g., sig1 = log preferences)
where gX indicates the annual productivity growth rate (e.g., g0 = 0% growth)
where bX indicates the annual discount factor (e.g., b985 = 1.5% pure rate of social time preference)
where dX indicates the decadal depreciation rate (e.g., d1 = 100% depreciation)
where notes indicate whether initial capital was re-calibrated (recalKO) or not (NOrecalK0) along with delta

5) The corresponding optimal allocations and policy variables are
provided in a separate folder "Saved Allocations". The labeling for these
variables is analogous to the primary model output.

PLEASE NOTE:
- The code is NOT written to automatically loop over different parameter
values and assumptions (e.g., whether to recalibrate initial capital K0
when the depreciation rate is changed). There main file is set up to 
produce one set of parameters with which the optimization routine proceeds.
Alternative options for the calibration - such as different growth rates -
are commented out with the "%" symbol. If one wishes to run a different
scenario, one thus has to manually un-comment the relevant section of the 
code and comment out the parts of the code one is replacing (e.g., 
un-comment the assumption that the discount rate "beta=(.999)^(10)" and 
comment out the currently active "beta=(.985)^10"), and then re-run the file.

- The graph-generating code is also commented out to avoid confusion, as it
calls on saved output for all the different variables (e.g., carbon taxes).
However, in order to use the code, one simply needs to un-comment it and
change the Matlab directory to the folder containing all the saved model output.
